## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (Easy to read markup)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive approach

### What I learned

This was my first challenge.

I've had some issues with placing all the content in the exact center of the page, I decided to use flexbox. 

My main problem was vertically centering the container. It was centered horizontally but sticking at the top of the page. 

I solved it making the html element of height 100vh, and the body element with a minimum width of 100vh.

```css

html {
  height: 100vh; /* 100 vh means 100% of viewport (the display size of the device you're using). It's an alternative to width: 100% */
}

body {
    min-height: 100vh; /* 100 vh means 100% of viewport, an alternative to 100% */
}

```

### Continued development

The next challenge will be something similar with some Javascript. 

I really enjoyed this challenge.

### Useful resources
